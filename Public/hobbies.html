    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
      By far the hardest thing for me is learning to play guitar, I've tried and
      gave up on it many times, but I'm still trying!

    <h2>Running</h2>
    <p>Inspired by my family, I'm also a runner. Currently still competing in the 5km 
        platoon, but always going a further when training.
