    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Here below, I'll list some projects that I have interest in doing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>5'S Sorter
            <p>A little program that my ex co-worker requested for me to sort 
                sectors and auditors for the 5'S program.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Habit tracker
            <p>A program that would look like Github's activity history to 
                help me keep playing guitar and maintain other healthy habits.
                It would always be displayed at a second monitor or something 
                like that to always remind me of my goals.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
